# Similar Doctors

A web application aimed at users searching for the perfect doctor to come into contact with. 

### Check out the site:

Heroku link: http://similardocs.herokuapp.com/

#### Assumptions:
1. I made the assumption that all of the data for the doctors had already been recorded. 
2. Additionally, I have all of the doctor's data stored on a .js file. In reality, the doctor's data would be stored in a secure database and not on a .js that is easy to access.

#### Total time spent: 
1. Around an hour total was spent outlining the whole application prior to writing the code
2. The total time for coding took around 5 hours, but was spread out throughout the weekend.

#### Other changes:
1. There are many more features that I'd be interested in implementing. To name a few examples: a search bar for looking up the names of doctors, a suggested page where users can find the most recommended doctor, user authorization/login, etc.
2. Visual changes, styling improvements
3. Small bug fixes
